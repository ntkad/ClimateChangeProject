 * Class to play the game - console-based game(NO GUI atm)
 * Basically, it can be a while loop that will be taking decison from the user, using a scanner,
 *             The decision should just be a selecting from the options we will give
 *            The loop terminates when the set number of years gets to zero
 *            The decision will be used to determine whether there is a benefit or loss.
 *            To determine whether there is a benefit or a loss, we use the data in dataStore.
 *            The benefit and loss classes will have the methods to do the required calculations 
 *                  to reduce or increase the years or money
