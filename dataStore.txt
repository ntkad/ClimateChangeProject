// This will be where the data used to show options to the player is going to be stored
// The format depends entirely on design decisions 
// an example can be 

// {“support conservation group” : [(benefit 1, +$1000, 2years), (benefit 2, $1200, 0years)]}

// Using this example, this line of data can then be used to create a Benefit(using the Benefit class)
